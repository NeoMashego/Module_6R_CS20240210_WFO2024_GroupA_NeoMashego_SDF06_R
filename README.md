# [SDF06] Project: CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile

Welcome to the CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile that has 3 main sections (two in containers and one footer)

# Container 1
Used to hold the profile picture, profile name, profile edit button, settings and the profile information of CodeSpace Pets.

# Container 2
Contains the layout of the pet images placed in 3 columns with spacing between them.
When hovering over the images you can see the likes, comments and gallery options.
